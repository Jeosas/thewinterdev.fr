## What I can do for You

    Web services are a good way to expose your brand or services to your users.
    I can help you with the creation of your services, may they be exposed internally or externally, and doing this alone or with your team.
- **DevOps.**
    Boost your teams' productivity by setting up DevOps practices! I can accompany you through this methodology with things like setting up automated pipelines for code analysis, software testing, packaging and deployment.

    With you, I'll setup automated testing of the security of your software before it reaches production.
