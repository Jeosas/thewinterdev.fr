I'm **Jean-Baptiste Wintergerst**, independent contractor and freelancer in software engineering and devops who focuses on finding cleaver solutions to complex problems, while keeping things simple stupid.
I love to automate things around me by learning ever more tools and technologies.
I live in Lyon, France, where I quench my thirst for mountain sports when I'm not listening to music or experimenting with new software or hardware.
