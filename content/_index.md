My name is **Jean-Baptiste Wintergerst**, independent contractor and freelancer in software engineering and devops who focuses on finding clever solutions to complex problems, while keeping things simple stupid.
I love to automate things around me by learning evermore tools and technologies.
Located in Lyon, France, I quench my thirst for mountain sports when I'm not listening to music or experimenting with new software or hardware.
